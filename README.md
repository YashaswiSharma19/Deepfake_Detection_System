## Introduction

The **Deepfake Detection App** is a deep learning-based application designed to detect deepfake images. Deepfakes are artificially generated or manipulated media used to create misleading or fabricated content. This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to analyze and classify images as either real or deepfake.

The model is trained on a dataset consisting of both authentic and deepfake images, utilizing advanced deep learning techniques to achieve accurate predictions. Users can upload images via the app's user-friendly interface, and the app will provide a prediction on whether the image is real or manipulated.

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of computer vision in combating the rising challenge of deepfake media, offering a tool for verifying the authenticity of images in various applications.
